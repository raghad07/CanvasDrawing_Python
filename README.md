# Canvas Drawing
This code allows you to create a canvas and draw rectangles and squares on it using the Canvas, Rectangle, and Square classes. The canvas is represented by a 3D NumPy array, where each element represents a pixel with RGB color values. The Canvas class provides methods to create the canvas, save it as an image file, and change the color of the canvas. The Rectangle and Square classes enable you to draw rectangles and squares on the canvas by modifying the corresponding regions in the canvas array.

# Features
Create a canvas with a specified height, width, and color.
Draw rectangles on the canvas by specifying the coordinates, height, width, and color.
Draw squares on the canvas by specifying the coordinates, side length, and color.
Save the canvas as an image file in PNG format.
Dynamically create a canvas by taking user input for the width, height, and color.
Interactively draw rectangles and squares on the canvas by entering the shape type, position, dimensions, and color.
Quit the drawing mode when desired.
How to Use
# Run the code.
You can either create a canvas with predefined dimensions and colors or dynamically create one by entering the width, height, and color.
If you choose to dynamically create the canvas, you will enter the desired dimensions and specify the color as either "white" or "black".
Once the canvas is created, you can start drawing shapes on it.
Enter the shape type ("rectangle" or "square") you want to draw.
Provide the required details for the shape, such as coordinates, dimensions, and color.
The shape will be drawn on the canvas.
Repeat steps 5-7 to draw more shapes on the canvas.
To finish drawing and save the canvas as an image file, enter "quit".
The canvas will be saved as a PNG image file named "canvas.png" in the same directory.
